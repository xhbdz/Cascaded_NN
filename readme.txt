tx:original input
txData:ideal DPD signal after ILC process
ILCï¼šDPD signal after proposed model

tx_30_140_65:original input with 30MHz BW,-14dBm PL and 6.5 dB PAPR
we use tx to fit txData in main.py and then obtain ILC for linearizing.

2.
the folder:linearized_data_with_proposed_model saves the linearized PA's outputs based on the proposed model, and they are also the data of the resubmitted paper.

If some open source libraries that need to be imported are missing, they can be downloaded through:pip install
