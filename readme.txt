tx:original input
txData:ideal DPD signal after ILC process
ILCï¼šDPD signal after proposed model

tx_30_140_65:original input with 30MHz BW,-14dBm PL and 6.5 dB PAPR
we use tx to fit txData in main.py and then obtain ILC for linearizing.

2.
the folder:linearized_data_with_proposed_model saves the linearized PA's outputs based on the proposed model, and they are also the data of the resubmitted paper.
